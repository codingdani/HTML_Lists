                    "Legion TD is a featured map of the stragegy role-playing game Warcraft 3. It's a tower defense game
                    with MOBA elements
                    that
                    supports singleplayer and co-op campaigns as well as 2v2 and 4v4 matchmaking. The basics are
                    simple—build an army, defend your king, eliminate the enemy—but the variety of unique factions and
                    fighters enables a tremendous range of offensive and defensive possibilities."

                    "Set in the fictional world of Azeroth, WoW allows players to create avatar-style characters and
                    explore a sprawling universe while interacting with nonreal players—called nonplayer characters
                    (NPCs)—and other real-world players (PCs). Various quests, battles, and missions are completed alone
                    or in guilds, and the rewards for success include gold, weapons, and valuable items, which are used
                    to improve one's character. Characters advance by killing other creatures to earn experience. Once
                    enough experience is acquired, the character gains a level, which increases the character's powers.
                    WoW offers a rich class system of characters, allowing gamers to play as druids, priests, rogues,
                    paladins, and other fantasy-related classes."

                    "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is an action RPG developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64.
                    The
                    game is set in the kingdom of Hyrule. A youth named Link sets out on a quest to prevent the thief
                    Ganondorf, the prime antagonist of the Legend of Zelda series, from obtaining the Triforce, a
                    magical relic of omnipotent power, an event foretold by the prophetic Princess Zelda. Due to
                    unforeseen circumstances, Ganondorf successfully obtains part of the Triforce. By traveling back and
                    forth through time using the mythical Master Sword, Link must amass the Six Medallions needed to
                    defeat Ganondorf and restore peace to Hyrule."

                    "Pokémon Gold Version and Pokémon Silver Version are 1999 role-playing video games developed by Game
                    Freak and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color. The games introduce 100 new species of
                    Pokémon and follow the progress of the player character in their quest to master Pokémon battling.
                    Both games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and, while both can be
                    played separately, it is necessary to trade between these games and their predecessors in order to
                    fully complete each games' Pokédex. The Johto Saga of the Pokémon anime is based on the new region
                    introduced in the games."
